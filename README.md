# Drowsiness Detection using YOLO

This project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time drowsiness detection. It captures video from the webcam, applies YOLO object detection, and identifies drowsiness based on facial landmarks and eye movements. Upon detection, it overlays bounding boxes around drowsy regions in the video stream.
